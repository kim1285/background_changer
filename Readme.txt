Dear user,

Thank you for downloading the background changer. Background changer program is a windows program to automatically change your background into pre-selected, groups of random pictures every two hours a day. The program is designed to give you a sense of passage of time throughout the day, by subtly reminding you of the visual changes of nature.



[Installation Instructions]

The background changer program is divided into three parts - "installation.exe", "background_changer.exe", "configuration.exe"

1. To install the program, you should locate the "installation.exe" and then double click to open it (manually opening it using elevated privilege is not recommanded). 

2.A command prompt will show up. You will be prompted to enter your pc's password(if you have one.) This is required to create windows task scheduler task initially.

- note: The program does not store the password. The windows task scheduler directly handle your password. Background changer does not have access to your password at any point by design, it just calls the windows task scheduler program you already have and then let them handle your pw. 



[About the images included]

The default pictures for each 2 hour frame of the day are gathered from unsplash.com. They are created by many talented individuals. You could find the name of the original authors of the pictures in each picture's name. I have not made any modifications of the pictures gathered from there.



[Security and Privacy]

Rest assured, the Background Changer does not collect or store any personal information from users. Your privacy and security are paramount.
